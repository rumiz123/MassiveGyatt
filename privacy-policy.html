    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the Massive Gyatt Blog (hereinafter referred to as "the Blog"), a satirical masterpiece dedicated to the fictional glory of Jiajun’s massive gyatt. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices—or lack thereof—regarding the collection, use, and protection of your personal information. Spoiler alert: we don’t really care about your data, but we’re legally obligated to say something about it. By accessing the Blog, you acknowledge that everything here is a joke and cannot be used against us in any way, shape, or form.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect almost nothing because, frankly, we’re too busy obsessing over Jiajun’s gyatt to bother with your personal life. The only data we snag is a single cookie (named "tosAccepted") to remember if you’ve clicked "I Accept" on our <a href="terms-of-service.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> popup. That’s it. No names, no emails, no secret gyatt-squeezing stats—unless you’re Jiajun, in which case, we salute you.</p>
    
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>That cookie? It’s just there to stop the ToS popup from harassing you every time you visit. We don’t sell it, trade it, or use it to summon demons. It sits quietly in your browser for 365 days, then poofs into oblivion. We’re not tracking your soul—Jiajun’s gyatt already stole ours.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Disclosure of Information</h2>
    <p>We won’t share your cookie with anyone unless the law comes knocking, and even then, we’ll just point them to Jiajun’s gyatt and run. No third parties, no advertisers, no sneaky shenanigans—because this is a joke site, and we’re not that organized.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We protect that one cookie with the ferocity of a caffeinated cheetah guarding a rollerblade factory—or, you know, basic HTML and JavaScript. It’s not Fort Knox, but it’s good enough for a site this ridiculous. If someone hacks us, they’ll just find endless rants about gyatt and a broken camera that still hasn’t snapped those pics.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can clear your cookies anytime and make that ToS popup haunt you again—your call. We don’t have a fancy GDPR form because we don’t have your data to begin with. Want to opt out? Close the tab and dream of Jiajun’s booty instead.</p>
    
    <h2>7. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>We link to our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/Ac9rqyxjXx" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/Ac9rqyxjXx</a>) and our ToS page. If you click those, their privacy policies apply, not ours. We’re not responsible if Discord decides to track your gyatt-related memes.</p>
    
    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We might update this Privacy Policy if we accidentally start caring about data—or if Jiajun’s gyatt demands it. Check back whenever. Or don’t. It’s a joke anyway.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>Got questions? Too bad—this is a satire site, and we’re not leaving an email. Join our Discord if you dare, but don’t expect serious answers. Gyatt bless.</p>
