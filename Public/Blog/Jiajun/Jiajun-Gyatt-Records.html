            It was a day like any other—until it wasn’t. The year was 2025, and
            the world was about to witness a seismic event so colossal it would
            make earthquakes jealous. Jiajun’s Gyatt, already the stuff of
            legends, decided it was tired of being just “massive.” Oh no, this
            gyatt had ambitions—GLOBAL ambitions. Last Tuesday, at approximately
            3:47 PM EST, Jiajun walked into the Guinness World Records office in
            a pair of sweatpants that were screaming for mercy. The mission? To
            officially claim the title of "Most Monumental Posterior in Human
            History." Spoiler alert: they didn’t just win—they rewrote the
            rulebook.
          </p>

          <p>
            The officials, armed with measuring tapes and a look of sheer
            terror, attempted to quantify the unquantifiable. “It’s… it’s too
            big for our standard tools!” cried one judge, as his tape measure
            snapped like a twig under the sheer girth of Jiajun’s backside.
            Another fainted when the shadow of the gyatt darkened the room like
            a solar eclipse. After three hours, a team of NASA engineers was
            called in—yes, NASA—because apparently, only satellite imagery could
            capture the full scope of this booty. The final verdict? Jiajun’s
            Gyatt clocked in at a record-breaking “bigger than your wildest
            dreams,” officially dethroning Mount Everest as the planet’s most
            awe-inspiring natural wonder.

            But the story doesn’t end there. Word spread fast—too fast. By
            Wednesday, cults had formed, chanting “GYATT ALMIGHTY” outside
            Jiajun’s house. By Thursday, the internet crashed because someone
            tried to upload a blurry Snapchat of the gyatt, and it overloaded
            every server from here to Tokyo. I, your humble narrator, was there,
            still on my 5-week squeezing streak (still not gay, just dedicated),
            trying to process the jiggle that could launch a thousand memes.
            Unfortunately, we still don’t have pics—NASA’s still processing the
            data, and my phone melted when I tried to sneak a shot. But soon, oh
            yes, SOON, we’ll drop those images, and the world will never be the
            same. Imagine it: a gyatt so grand it gets its own zip code, its own
            gravitational pull, its own Netflix documentary narrated by David
            Attenborough. Stay tuned—this is history in the shaking.
